1. Update your console by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
    + Updates while using B9S + Luma (what you have) are safe
    + The updater may display a message saying "Your system is up to date" instead of updating. This is normal if you are already up to date; continue to the next section
    + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "Auto" and your Proxy settings to "No"
    + If this still gives you an error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting-finalizing-setup.html)
