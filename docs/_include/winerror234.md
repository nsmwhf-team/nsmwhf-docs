When creating the MSET9 ID1 on Windows 10 and above, the script may fail with this error:

![](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/234.png)

This occurs because of the beta UTF-8 support in Windows. You must disable it to run MSET9:

1. Hit **Windows Key + R** to open up the Run dialogue, type `intl.cpl` then click "OK"
